# Music.CLI
	This project is to allow people to play their own music from the CLI (Command Line Interface)

# Motivation
	Sometimes I just like having a screen full of terminal open, and this project will eventually add services that will let you stream music from them (Pandora, Spotify, SoundCloud, etc...).
